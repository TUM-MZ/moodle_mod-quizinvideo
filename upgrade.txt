This files describes API changes in the quizinvideo code.

=== 2.8 ===

* Classes that were defined in various lib files have been moved to the classes
  folder to take advantage of auto-loading. This has involved renaming them.
  see the list in mod/quizinvideo/db/renamedclasses.php.

* The quizinvideo no longer handles its own \mod_quizinvideo\event\attempt_becameoverdue event,
  and so the event handler function quizinvideo_attempt_overdue_handler has been deleted.
  Also, the internal function quizinvideo_send_overdue_message has add the arguments
  changed. It now takes the $attemptobj object, not separate stdClass objects.

* Major changes to the Edit quizinvideo page.

  The goal of this work was to increase usability, and also clean up the page
  enough that it will be possible to add new features in future.

  Display of mod/quizinvideo/edit.php is now entirely generated by
  mod_quizinvideo\output\edit_renderer. This uses a helper class mod_quizinvideo\structure
  to provide details of the structure of the quizinvideo, and mod_quizinvideo\repaginate to
  alter that structure. (Actually, there are still some modification methods on
  mod_quizinvideo\structure. Expect that to be cleaned up in future.)

  The new code uses much more ajax, and there are new scripts mod/quizinvideo/edit_rest.php
  and mod/quizinvideo/repaginate.php to handle this. (Again, don't be surprised if those
  two scripts get merged in future.) Also questionbank.ajax.php (which may, in
  future, be made more generic, and moved into the core question bank code.)

  As a result of this, mod/quizinvideo/editlib.php has gone. (A few remaining functions
  were moved to locallib.php.)

  Here is a list of all the old functions or classes that have changed.
  If you used any of these in custom code, you will need to update your code.
  (Note that many of these functions should have been considered private internals
  of the quizinvideo module, and you should not have been using them!)

  From editlib.php:
      quizinvideo_remove_slot
      quizinvideo_delete_empty_page
      quizinvideo_add_page_break_after_slot    - Use methods of structure or repaginate
      quizinvideo_update_slot_maxmark          - classes instead.
      _quizinvideo_move_question
      quizinvideo_move_question_up
      quizinvideo_move_question_down

      quizinvideo_print_question_list
      quizinvideo_print_pagecontrols
      quizinvideo_print_singlequestion         - Use methods of edit_renderer instead.
      quizinvideo_print_randomquestion
      quizinvideo_print_singlequestion_reordertool
      quizinvideo_print_randomquestion_reordertool
      print_random_option_icon
      quizinvideo_print_grading_form
      quizinvideo_print_status_bar

  Moved from editlib.php to locallib.php:
      quizinvideo_question_tostring - now always returns a string (the only option used).
                               The $return argument has gone.

  Old editing JavaScript (e.g. mod/quizinvideo/edit.js) is gone. Replaced with YUI modules.


=== 2.7.1 ===

* The function quizinvideo_fire_attempt_started_event has been removed. This function
  should not have been used outside the quizinvideo, but if you were using it, you should
  trigger the event outside this function. Note that the appropriate start event is
  fired automatically by the quizinvideo_attempt_save_started function.

=== 2.7 ===

* The old quizinvideo.questions database column (comma-separated list of question ids)
  is gone, and instead the quizinvideo_question_instances table has been renamed to
  to quizinvideo_slots. Some of the columns of that table have been renamed to match
  the coding guidelines. Specifically:
      quizinvideo     -> quizinvideoid
      question -> questionid
      grade    -> maxmark
  also there are two new columns:
      slot     -  numbers the questions in the quizinvideo in order, as on the edit quizinvideo page.
      page     -  new way to determine which question is on which page.
  naturally, other parts of the code and APIs have been updated to reflect that
  change.

* The following functions, which were part of the internal workings of the quizinvideo,
  have been removed.
      quizinvideo_get_slot_for_question
      quizinvideo_number_of_questions_in_quizinvideo
      quizinvideo_repaginate               (there is now a quizinvideo_repaginate_questions with a different API).
      quizinvideo_add_page_break_at        (see quizinvideo_add_page_break_after_slot)
      quizinvideo_add_page_break_after     (see quizinvideo_add_page_break_after_slot)
      quizinvideo_number_of_pages
      quizinvideo_remove_question          (see quizinvideo_remove_slot)
      quizinvideo_update_question_instance (see quizinvideo_update_slot_maxmark)

* The following internal functions have had their API changed.
      quizinvideo_delete_empty_page: has had its arguments changed to $quizinvideo and $pagenumber.
      quizinvideo_has_question_use: now takes $quizinvideo and $slot, not $questionid.

=== 2.6 ===

* As part of improving the page usability and accessibility, we updated the
  heading levels for quizinvideo module so it has a proper nesting. (MDL-41615)

* mod_quizinvideo_renderer::view_best_score has been removed. (It did not do what the
  name suggested anyway.)


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_quizinvideo_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
